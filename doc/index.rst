NLP in Rust with Python bindings

This package aims to provide a high performance toolkit for ingesting textual data for
machine learning applications.

Features
--------

 - Tokenization: Regexp tokenizer, Unicode segmentation + language specific rules
 - Stemming: Snowball (in Python 15-20x faster than NLTK)
 - Token counting: converting token counts to sparse matrices for use
   in machine learning libraries. Similar to `CountVectorizer` and
   `HashingVectorizer` in scikit-learn.
 - Levenshtein edit distance; SÃ¸rensen-Dice, Jaro, Jaro Winkler string similarities
